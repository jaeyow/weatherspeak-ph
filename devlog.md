## PR #0 — Project Kickoff & Planning
**Date:** 2026-04-10  
**Branch:** `main` (initial commit)  
**Commit:** `ced18fe`

### What we did
- Defined the project concept: **WeatherSpeak PH** — AI-powered multilingual severe weather communications for the Philippines
- Identified the core problem: PAGASA issues typhoon bulletins in English only, leaving 74+ Filipino language communities underserved during disasters
- Designed the full technical architecture:
  - PDF ingestion and parsing (pdfplumber / PyPDF2)
  - Gemma 4 (26B/31B) for translation and multimodal bulletin map understanding
  - Deployment: Gemma 4 served via **Ollama on Modal** (serverless GPU)
  - Google Cloud TTS for audio generation (Tagalog native, Bisaya fallback)
  - Mobile-first PWA frontend (Next.js / Vercel)
  - Supabase/PostgreSQL for bulletin storage
- Selected hackathon tracks:
  - **Impact Track — Digital Equity & Inclusivity** ($10k)
  - **Impact Track — Global Resilience** ($10k)
  - **Special Technology Track — Ollama** ($10k)
  - **Main Track** (grand prize contender)
- Scoped the implementation roadmap across 5 weeks (Apr 10 – May 18)
- Created `.gitignore` and committed `HACKATHON_PLAN.md`
- Created public GitHub repo: [jaeyow/weatherspeak-ph](https://github.com/jaeyow/weatherspeak-ph)

### Key decisions
- Focus on 2 dialects for hackathon: Tagalog + Bisaya/Cebuano
- Two processing modes: Mode 1 (latest bulletin translation) and Mode 2 (full storm narrative synthesis — stretch goal)
- Multimodal: use Gemma 4 vision to interpret storm track maps embedded in PDF bulletins
- Dropped Unsloth track — no LLM fine-tuning in scope; using Filipino TTS to read Bisaya text as an acceptable Phase 1 fallback
- Server-side inference only (no offline/edge deployment)

## PR #1 — OCR Notebook Experiments
**Date:** 2026-04-10  
**Branch:** `feature/ocr-experiments`  
**Status:** In progress

### Goals
- Explore PDF parsing approaches on real PAGASA bulletin PDFs
- Evaluate text extraction quality (pdfplumber vs PyPDF2 vs OCR fallback)
- Identify structure of bulletins: storm name, category, wind speed, warnings, affected areas, coordinates
- Test Gemma 4 vision on bulletin map images extracted from PDFs
- Produce structured JSON output from a sample bulletin
